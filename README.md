# Icinga-Scripts
Archive of Icinga scripts, checks and otherwise.

This repository contains scripts written over many years that provided custom checks for Icinga and Icinga2 monitoring. There are three major types of scripts:
* Checks - They gather system data and report to the monitoring system
* Cacti - Scripts that return statistical data in format acceptible to Cacti
* Config - These are really installer scripts that eased installation in the absense of an enterprise automation tool
